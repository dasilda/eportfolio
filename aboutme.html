<h2>From Albania to New York City: Embracing my new chapter</h2>
    <p>Born and raised in Albania, my early years were filled with strong traditions and culture of the country. I am of the outside kid generation, and I'm happy I got to enjoy playing with neighbours and cousins all the summers, instead of being locked inside watching on the phone all day. I have really great memories that I will cheris forever.</p>
    <p>Two years ago, I took the bold step and moved to New York City, where my journey being independent started. Living alone in this fast-paced city has been extremely challenging so far. It was so hard for me to leave my life in Albania behind, I'm still working on it. However, the transition into this new life also opened doors to many opportunities for personal growth and connections. In the beginning I was focused on only working and making a living for myself, while now I’ve gotten into studies as well, pursuing my dream of becoming a video editor.</p>
    
<h2>Balancing Work, Study, and Life</h2>
    <p> When it comes to balancing work, study and life, I struggle. Each of them demands time and energy and this sometimes brings me to self-doubt and getting overwhelmed. However, these struggles have taught me many lessons, reminding me to be determined, while prioritizing to take care of myself first. Despite all the challenges, I was able to go and explore the city, make new friends, embrace diversity and appreciate the nuances of human experiences. I love and admire what I see around me everywhere, so I’m very optimistic and fully excited for the future ahead. As I keep going on this journey, I realize that finding myself is a continuous process and I must be committed to building my character and embrace each moment, both the highs and the lows, until I'm able to create a fulfilling life for myself.</p>

<h2>Hobbies and Likes</h2>
    <p> I love listening to music. I am into K-Pop a lot for the past years, but in general I prefer EDM and Pop music. My favorite artists are BTS, Martin Garrix and Alan Walker. I like studying new languages whenever I feel like being productive in my free time. I love watching cartoons (it doesn't matter how old I get), movies of any kind, kdramas and Turkish soap operas. I love cats a lot. </p>
