    <p>For this image, I used Photoshop. I chose a sunset background from Studio Ghibli. I added a photo of myself kissed by the sun to match it. I chose this cause it is my favorite time of the day, when I feel the most excited and full of energy. Then I added randomly some of my favorite characters, which most of them  happen to be from Studio Ghibli as well. Also there is my favorite artist, presented on a drawing as chibis on top of a whale. </p>

    <p>I have a variety of hobbies and preferences in many fields, however for this image I chose Red Wine. I started loving it since I was a kid, it just grew on me. I love the taste of it, but I don't abuse with it, don't worry!!! </p>
    <p>As for the work of it, I used Adobe Illustrator. </p>
