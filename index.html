    <p>In this website, I am going to share a bit about my life, as well as some of my creations using photoshop, illustrator and audicity. Each piece is inspired by my experiences and what I like the most. Also, being photography lover, I am going to share some of the photos I've taken of the places and cats.  </p>
    <p>I am from Albania, but I have moved to New York City, where I'm planing to live and pursuit my aspirations and goals. Despite obstacles throughout each day, I remain determined to stay motivated and encouraged to work hard until I turn my dreams into reality. </p>
