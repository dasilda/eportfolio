    Welcome to my webpage, where I'm going to share with you why artwork, starting from images and ending with animation. But before we jump into that, I would like to talk a little about who I am and what is my want in life.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 14; color: cadetblue">    
    I am from Albania, but I have moved to New York City, where I'm planing to live and pursue my aspirations and goals. Despite obstacles throughout each day, I remain determined to stay motivated and encouraged to work hard until I turn my dreams into reality.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 12; color: cadetblue">
